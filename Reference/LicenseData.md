# LicenseData

---

Specifies a text file or a RTF file to use for the license that the user can read. Omit this to not have a license displayed. Note that the file must be in the evil DOS text format (\r\n, yeah!). To define a multilingual license data use [`LicenseLangString`][1].
If you make your license file a RTF file it is recommended you edit it with WordPad and not MS Word. Using WordPad will result in a much smaller file.
Use [`LicenseLangString`][1] to show a different license for every language.
